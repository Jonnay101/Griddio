# Griddio
simple css grid

This is a small project i started in an attempt to learn more about css grid systems... at the same time as learning a bit more about what sass/scss has to offer.

I've included an html file with the key for the classes you should add in your html.
Just link to the griddio.css file and your on your way.

It's not currently tested on multiple browsers.
Please feel free to tinker and improve!!!
